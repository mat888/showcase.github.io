    "A class and set are objects which can contain elements. A set is a special kind of class; one that is restricted in quality by the axioms of set theory to avoid paradoxes such as the one below. In the langauge of First Order Logic, classes can be constructed as follows:\n",

    "Given a class $C$, we define its members to be classes which are not elements of themselves. The most confusing concept to wrap one's mind around here is the idea of a class containing itself, but having an intuitive understanding will not be as important as carefully applying the definitions and following the implications of doing so, as is done below.\n",

    "An interesting question to ask is whether or not $C$ contains itself. With the principle of the excluded middle in mind (an accepted rule in the context of set theory stating that *a logical conclusion is either true or false - and no other combination like TT, FF, or neither*) we investigate by examining either conclusion:\n",

    "By the definition of $C$, it contains all classes which are not members of themselves, therefore if $C$ is not self containing as we just asserted then it must be in $C$, which implies that it contains itself, contradicting the assumption that it is not a member of itself.\n",

    "This fundamental flaw in what is now known as 'niave set theory' motivated the formal set theories we have today which introduce the notion of sets as opposed to classes - sets in set theory are specific types of classes with restrictions in place to avoid such paradoxes. Though less straightforward, the sets laid out in these theories give rise to previously disperate mathematics - unifying and justifying thousands of years of work into a single framework."
