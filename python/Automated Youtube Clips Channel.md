I'm keeping the code itself hidden for now, but if you'd like proof of ownership I would be happy to send you a message from the channel.

This challenge presented many challenges along the way, mostly organizational. A unique algorithm had to be made to determine the 'best' clips of the day, and the database had to be kept well organized to keep the project ordered and maintainable. The structure of the program consists of several python files responsible for different jobs like fetching, editing and posting clips.
