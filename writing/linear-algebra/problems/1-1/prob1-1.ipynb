This is because of a general pattern starting from a single point, and transforming it into a line (transforming a 0D cube into a 1D cube): Take every point and give it a companion point (which also happens to be at a right angle to its pairwise point). This means that every transformation into the next dimension multiples the points, or corners, of the previous dimension by two, hence $2^n$."

Since a single 3D cube is composed of eight corners, the $2^4 * 4 = 64$ can be divided by eight to determine that there are eight 3D cubes in one 4D cube. "
