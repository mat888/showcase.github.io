Salty bet was my first go at a serious Python Discord bot. The functionality of this bot is to read specific messages from a Twitch chat which announced randomized automated video game fights on a stream, internalize the information on the fighters and winners, and use that interactivity in the discord bot for my friends and I to enjoy.

This project is uncomplete, but it at least has the heavy lifting accomplished. It succesfully, headlessly reads the correct messages from Twitch, and allows users in Discord to see and select who they believe will win. Past that the only thing left to do is basic game logic like a score/rank system, but something about making it through difficulty of opening sockets and using async for the first time made those final simpler tasks seem a bit uncompelling (especially since this wasn't paid work).
